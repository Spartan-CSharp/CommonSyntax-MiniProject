# CommonSyntax-MiniProject
The homework from the Lesson 5, Mini-Project, of Module 2, Common Syntax, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to plan and build a Console Application that asks a user for their name and their age. If their name is Bob or Sue, address them as professor. If the person is under 21, recommend they wait X years to start this class.
